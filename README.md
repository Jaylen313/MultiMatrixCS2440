Matrix Multiplication Program in C 
(Provided Two forms of matrix multiplication using user input and scanning files)

This C program takes an integer input between 1 and 10 or two file paths as input. If the user provides an integer, 
the program generates two random matrices of size N by N, where N is the input integer. It then multiplies these matrices 
and displays the random generated matrices as well as the resulting matrix. If the user provides file paths, the program 
expects the matrix to be stored in the files with the size of each matrix specified in the first line, separated by a space. 
For example, for a 2 by 3 matrix, the first line of the file should contain ‘2 3’, followed by the actual matrix on the next 
lines. The program performs error checks for matric dimensions and file access.
